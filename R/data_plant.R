#' Plant survey data collected by NEON
#'
#' This dataset was derived from [NEON data portal](https://data.neonscience.org) with data product ID 'DP1.10058.001'. Details about this data product can be found at <https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10058.001>
#'
#' The detailed design of NEON plant survey can be found in [Barnett et al. 2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2603).
#' Here, we:
#'
#' 1. Removed 1 m^2 data with `targetTaxaPresent = N`
#' 2. Removed rows missing values for plotID, subplotID, boutNumber, endDate, and/or taxonID
#' 3. Removed duplicate taxa between nested subplots (each taxon should be represented once for the bout/plotID/year). For example, if a taxon/date/bout/plot combo is present in 1 m^2 data, remove from 10 m^2 and above
#' 4. Stacked species occurrence from different scales into a long data frame. Therefore,
#'     + to get the species list at 1 m^2 scale, we need all the data with `sample_area_m2 == 1` (e.g. `dplyr::filter(plants, sample_area_m2 == 1)`); the unique sample unit id can then be generated with `paste(plants$plotID, plants$subplot_id, plants$subsubplot_id, sep = "_")`
#'     + to get the species list at 10 m^2 scale, we need all the data with `sample_area_m2 <= 10` (e.g. `dplyr::filter(plants, sample_area_m2 <= 10)`); the unique sample unit id can then be generated with `paste(plants$plotID, plants$subplot_id, plants$subsubplot_id, sep = "_")`
#'     + to get the species list at 100 m^2 scale, we need use the whole data set since the maximum value of `sample_area_m2` is 100 (i.e. a 10 m by 10 m subplot); the unique sample unit id can then be generated with `paste(plants$plotID, plants$subplot_id, sep = "_")`
#'     + to get the species list at 400 m^2 scale (i.e. one plot with four subplots), we need aggregate the data at `plotID` level (the sample unit is the plot now).
#'
#' @note  Details of locations (e.g. latitude/longitude coordinates can be found in [neon_locations]).
#' @format A data frame (also a tibble) with the following columns:
#'
#' - `namedLocation`: Name of the measurement location in the NEON database.
#' - `siteID`: NEON site code.
#' - `plotID`: Plot identifier (NEON site code_XXX).
#' - `subplotID`: This is the NEON provided subplot ID in the format of `subplot_id`, then `subsubplot_id` and 1 or 10 (m^2); if the sampling unit is 100 m^2, the values are 31, 32, 40, and 41.
#' - `boutNumber`: Number of sampling bout, most sites sample only 1 bout.
#' - `year`: Observation year.
#' - `endDate`: The end date-time or interval during which an event occurred.
#' - `taxonID`: Species code, based on one or more sources. Mostly from the USDA PLANTS Database.
#' - `scientificName`: Scientific name, associated with the taxonID. This is the name of the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.
#' - `taxonRank`: The rank of `scientificName`: 'genus', 'species', 'speciesGroup', 'subSpecies', or 'variety.' Species accounts for the majority of the entries. _Higher ranks have already been filtered out_ because we think they are too vague for biodiversity research.
#' - `family`: The family of the species.
#' - `nativeStatusCode`: Whether the species is a native or non-native species. 'A': Presumed absent, due to lack of data indicating a taxon's presence in a given location; 'N': Native; 'N?': Probably Native; 'I': Introduced; 'I?': Probably Introduced; 'NI': Native and Introduced, some infrataxa are native and others are introduced; 'NI?': Probably Native and Introduced, some infrataxa are native and others are introduced; 'UNK': Status unknown.
#' - `percentCover`: Ocular estimate of cover of the index (e.g., species) as a percent within 1 m^2 subsubplots.
#' - `heightPlantOver300cm`: Indicator of whether individuals of the species in the sample are taller than 300 cm.
#' - `heightPlantSpecies`: Ocular estimate of the height (centimeter) of the plant species (if height is < 300 cm).
#' - `sample_area_m2`: The area of the sampling unit that the observed plant was located in.
#' - `subplot_id`: Subplot ID; each plot normally has four 100 m^2 subplots (31, 32, 40, 41).
#' - `subsubplot_id`: Subsubplot ID (1, 2, 3, 4) for sampling units at 1 m^2 or 10 m^2.
