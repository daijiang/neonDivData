\format{
A data frame (also a tibble) with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{siteID}: NEON site code.
\item \code{sampleID}: Identifier for sample.
\item \code{namedLocation}:	Name of the measurement location in the NEON database.
\item \code{collectDate}: Date of the collection event.
\item \code{scientificName}:	Scientific name, associated with the taxonID. This is the name
of the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.
\item \code{taxonID}: Accepted species code, based on one or more sources. This is renamed from the \code{acceptedTaxonID} column so that column names are consistent across different taxonomic groups.
\item \code{taxonRank}: The lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined for the individual or specimen.
\item \code{subsamplePercent}: Percent of the total sample contained in the subsample.
\item \code{individualCount}:	Number of individuals of the same type.
\item \code{estimatedTotalCount}: Estimated total count of individuals within a sample,
of given taxon, life stage, and size class.
