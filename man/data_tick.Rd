\title{Ticks sampled using drag cloths}
\format{
A data frame (also a tibble) with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{namedLocation}: Name of the measurement location in the NEON database.
\item \code{siteID}: NEON site code.
\item \code{plotID}: Plot identifier (NEON site code_XXX).
\item \code{collectDate}: Date of the collection event.
\item \code{eventID}: An identifier for the set of information associated with the event, which includes information about the place and time of the event.
\item \code{sampleID}: Identifier for sample.
\item \code{sampleCode}: Barcode of a sample.
\item \code{samplingMethod}: Name or code for the method used to collect or test a sample.
\item \code{totalSampledArea}: Total area sampled (square Meter).
\item \code{targetTaxaPresent}: Indicator of whether the sample contained individuals of the target taxa ('Y' or 'N').
\item \code{remarks_field}: Technician notes; free text comments accompanying the record.
\item \code{taxonID}: Accepted species code, based on one or more sources. This is renamed from the \code{acceptedTaxonID} column so that column names are consistent across different taxonomic groups.
\item \code{LifeStage}: Life stage of the sample ('Adult', 'Larva', or 'Nymph').
\item \code{IndividualCount}: Number of individuals of the same type.
\item \code{taxonRank}: The lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined for the individual or specimen.
\item \code{scientificName}: Scientific name, associated with the taxonID. This is the name of the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.

This dataset was derived from \href{https://data.neonscience.org}{NEON data portal} with data product ID 'DP1.10093.001'. Details about this data product can be found at \url{https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10093.001}.

\details{
Here, we:
\enumerate{
\item Removed field samples that had logistical issues (\code{samplingImpractical}!="OK")
\item Removed field samples that had  were not counted yet (e.g. 2019 data) e.g. require non NA values in \code{adultCount}, \code{nymphCount}, and \code{larvaCount}
\item Removed samples that had field counts but no associated taxonomy record, e.g. ticks were present in the field but there was no associated \code{sampleID} in the taxonomy (mostly 2019 records that haven't been ID'd yet). Also remove records in the taxonomy table that have no associated field data (\code{sampleID} present in taxonomy table but not field table). Records removed are mostly legacy.
\item Removed any sample in the taxonomy dataset that did not have a \code{sampleCondition} of "OK", or has an NA in \code{identifiedDate} or \code{acceptedTaxonID}
\item Removed samples in the taxonomy dataset that had \code{remarks} indicating a mis-identification. This included the following remarks: ("insect", "mite", "not a tick", "NOT A TICK", "arachnid", "spider").
\item Created a \code{lifeStage} column: this was either Nymph, Larvae, or Adult. Any tick that was sexed (e.g. \code{sexOrAge} was Male or Female) was assigned to the Adult lifestage. The Nymph or Larvae assignments were taken from the \code{sexOrAge} column.
\item Widened the taxonomy data so that each column is a unique taxonomicID_lifestage and each row is a sample. In doing so, we dropped the Sex information and summed M and F counts into a total adult count (i.e. we grouped by \code{sampleID}, \code{acceptedTaxonID}, and \code{lifeStage} and summed counts).
\item Left-joined the tick field data to tick taxonomy data using the \code{sampleID}. This retains 0 counts from the field data which will not have a record in the taxonomy table.
\item For any record where no ticks were found in the field (\code{targetTaxaPresent}=="N"), assigned 0s to all taxonomicID_lifestage columns.
\item For records where ticks were mis-id'd (see step 5) and there are no tick counts, adjusted the field count to 0.
\item Fixed count discrepancies between field and lab (note that as of 2019 counts may ONLY come from lab so this may not be necessary in future). Note that the lab count was used as the source of final counts per species-lifestage. When discrepancies were minor we trusted the lab counts. When discrepancies were larger, we used the following decisions:
11a. In cases where the field count total was greater than the taxonomic count total AND the discrepancy was in the larval stages, we assumed the lab stopped ID'ing after a certain count. We added the additional, un-ID'd "field" larvae to \code{IXOSP2_Larva} (the highest taxonomic ID)
11b. In other cases where field count was greater than the taxonomic count and there were \code{remarks_field} we assumed the remarks were about lost ticks (a common remark). We assigned any un-identified ticks to IXOSP2.
11c. Some counts did not match because there were too many samples sent to the lab and the invoice limit was reached. If the taxonomy table contained remarks about "invoice limit" or "billing limit" for a given sample ID, we trusted the field counts and added any difference between field and lab counts to the IXOSP2 column. \emph{Note this was a conservative decision but one could reasonably assume that counts assigned to IXOSP2 would really belong to whatever lower order taxonomy was commonly ID'd for the remaining samples.}.
11d. Removed any remaining samples where field and lab counts were off by >30\% and there was no obvious explanation.
