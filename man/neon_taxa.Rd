\title{Taxanomic names of all groups}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{taxonID}: Species code, based on one or more sources. For algae, macroinvertebrate, and tick, this is from the \code{acceptedTaxonID} column (which was removed here) so that all taxonomic groups have the same variable name. In another word, algae, macroinvertebrate, and tick only have \code{acceptedTaxonID} and we just renamed it to \code{taxonID} for these groups following other groups.
\item \code{scientificName}:	Scientific name, associated with the taxonID. This is the name
of the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.
\item \code{taxonRank}: The lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined for the individual or specimen.
\item \code{family}: The scientific name of the family in which the taxon is classified.
Not every taxonomic group has this information in the NEON data, but should be relatively easy to get from online databases.
\item \code{identificationReferences}: A list of sources (concatenated and semicolon separated)
used to derive the specific taxon concept; including field guide editions, books,
or versions of NEON keys used.
\item \code{taxa}: The taxa group that the location information can be used for.
Note that some taxa groups may have the same 'plotID' but their
latitude/longitude may differ slightly, which justifies the need of this column.
\item \code{neonDPI}: The NEON data product ID. See \code{neonUtilities:::table_types} for all
available data types and their data product IDs provided by NEON.
}

\description{
This data frame was put together from each data product, with the extra column of \code{identificationReferences}.
}
\note{
Some taxonomic groups used \code{taxonID} in the data product while other groups used \code{acceptedTaxonID}.
In addition, all data were from NEON and we did not do extra clean up. For example, sometimes, a species
does not have family information (\code{NA}) while another co-genera species does.
