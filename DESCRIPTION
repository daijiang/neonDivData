Description: Cleaned, simplified, and standardized NEON organismal data for biodiversity research. 
    The following taxonomic groups are included so far: algae, beetles, birds, fish, herptiles, 
    macroinvertebrates, mosquitoes, plants, small_mammals, ticks, tick_pathogens, and zooplankton.
    NEON input data (<https://data.neonscience.org>) were processed and standardized using R
    package `ecocomDP` (<https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP>).
